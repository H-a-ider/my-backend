# my-backend

## Overview

This repository contains a Next.js API route with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware configured. CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers that restricts webpages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the original webpage. This middleware allows you to control which domains are permitted to access your API.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before running the application:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Zeeshan1920/my-backend
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd my-backend
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To run the Next.js API, use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev



**API Logic**
The API logic in this example is simple; it responds with a JSON object containing a greeting message. You can customize this logic based on your application's requirements.

**Environment Variables**
The API logic also uses an environment variable (process.env.NAME) to personalize the greeting message. You can set this variable in a .env file or as part of your deployment process.
