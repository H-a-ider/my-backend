# my-backend
**Overview**
This repository contains a Next.js API route with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware configured. CORS is a security feature implemented 
by web browsers that restricts webpages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the original webpage. This middleware allows 
you to control which domains are permitted to access your API.

**Prerequisites**
Make sure you have the following installed before running the application:
```Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en```

**Installation**
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```git clone https://github.com/Zeeshan1920/my-backend```

Change into the project directory:
```cd your-repository```

Install the dependencies:
```npm install```


**Usage**
To run the Next.js API, use the following command:
```npm run dev```
This will start the development server, and your API will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/api/your-endpoint. Replace your-endpoint with the actual 
endpoint you've defined in your project.


**API Logic**
The API logic in this example is simple; it responds with a JSON object containing a greeting message. You can customize this logic based on your application's requirements.

**Environment Variables**
The API logic also uses an environment variable (process.env.NAME) to personalize the greeting message. You can set this variable in a .env file or as part of your deployment process.
